Developers now reach for AI APIs as naturally as they reach for database clients.
The shift from rule-based systems to neural language models has accelerated
since the release of GPT-3 in 2020, and the pace has only increased with
instruction-tuned models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. These models can
write code, explain concepts, extract information, and reason through complex
problems - tasks that previously required specialised rule-based systems or
significant human effort."""
